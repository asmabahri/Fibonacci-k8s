For testing purposes, this dumb fibonacci app is a way lot 
more complicated than it has to be but, that's a good example
of how to deploy a multi container app.

Techs used are :
    - nginx routing to & React App
    - Express server connected to :
    - redis + Worker & (redis storing the calculated value 
      of the index passed to the fibonacci function)
    - Postgres (storing just the index of the fibonnaci function : fibonacci(index))
